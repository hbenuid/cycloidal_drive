## 1. Drive Geometry

### 1.1 Ring Gear

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Number of ring pins | 21 | N + 1 where N = 20 lobes |
| Ring pin diameter | 4.00mm | Ground steel dowel, h6 tolerance |
| Ring pin circle ⌀ | 108.00mm | Centered in housing bore |
| Ring pin length | 35mm | 3.5mm motor plate engagement + 28mm bore zone (open) + 3.5mm bearing-zone wall engagement. Motor plate has 9mm through-holes; pin sits at the inner end with 5.5mm of empty hole at the outer face. |
| Housing bore ⌀ | 116.00mm | 140mm OD − 2 × 12mm wall |

### 1.2 Cycloidal Disc

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Number of lobes | 20 | Sets the ratio |
| Disc count | 2 | Orbit centers 180° apart to cancel vibration; disc 2's epitrochoid profile is phase-rotated by −180°/N_lobes = −9° relative to disc 1 so lobes mesh correctly with ring pins. Output-pin hole positions are identical between the two discs (disc-local 0°/90°/180°/270° on a 60 mm circle); only the profile is rotated. Disc 1 and disc 2 are **not interchangeable** printed parts — see `cfg.gear.disc2_phase_deg`. |
| Approximate OD | ~108mm | Defined by epitrochoid profile |
| Center bore ⌀ | 35.10mm | 35mm bearing OD + 0.10mm clearance (PETG) |
| Disc thickness | 10.00mm | Matched to 6003-2RS bearing width |
| Lobe chamfer | 1.00mm × 45° | Both Z faces of outer epitrochoid; assembly lead-in past ring pins, hides elephant foot. Symmetric so disc has no "wrong side". Costs ~20% lobe contact length. |
| Inter-disc spacer | 2.00mm | Separates the two discs |
| Output pin holes | 4× equally spaced | See Section 1.3 |

### 1.3 Output Stage

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Output pin count | 4 | Equally spaced at 90° |
| Output pin circle ⌀ | 60.00mm | — |
| Output pin ⌀ | 4.00mm | 4mm × 45mm h6 ground steel dowel pin |
| Disc pin hole ⌀ | 8.00mm | 4mm pin + 2 × 1.5mm ecc + 1mm clearance |
| Pin hole approach | Oversized, no bearings | Greased sliding fit through discs (8mm); blind clearance holes in hub (4.20mm × 19mm deep), captured between closed hub ceiling and motor plate inner face |

**Clearance check — output pin holes:**

- Pin hole center radius: 30.00mm
- Pin hole edge (inner): 30.00 − 4.00 = 26.00mm from center
- Center bore radius: 17.55mm
- **Wall between bore and pin hole: 8.45mm** ✓
- Pin hole edge (outer): 30.00 + 4.00 = 34.00mm from center
- Disc lobe valley (approx inner radius): ~49mm from center
- **Wall between pin hole and lobe root: ~15mm** ✓

### 1.4 Eccentric Shaft

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Shaft OD at bearing seats | 17.10mm | Slight clearance for 6003 bearing bore |
| Eccentricity | 1.50mm | Offset between shaft center and bearing seat center |
| Spine OD | 5.00mm | Between lobes |
| Input collar OD | 10.00mm | Enlarged input section for D-bore wall |
| D-bore ⌀ | 5.13mm | Receives motor shaft directly (5.00mm + 2×0.065mm clearance) |
| D-bore flat | 4.50mm | Matches motor shaft D-cut |
| D-bore depth | 14.00mm | Provides 13mm motor shaft engagement + 1mm bottom clearance (motor shaft 22mm − motor plate 9mm = 13mm) |
| Support pin hole ⌀ | 5.15mm | Blind hole for 5mm steel dowel clearance fit (5.00 + 2×0.075mm) |
| Support pin hole depth | 11.00mm | Through lobe 2 + 1mm into bridge; shortened from 12mm to keep 1mm wall to deepened D-bore |
| Support pin | 5mm × 20mm ground steel dowel, h6 | Press-fit into shaft, supports 625 bearing |
| Material | PETG | 3D printed; use 100% infill, 0.16mm layer height |

The eccentric shaft has two lobes offset 180° from each other, one per disc. Each lobe is a cylindrical section with center offset 1.5mm from the shaft axis. The input end has a D-bore socket that receives the motor shaft directly (no coupler). A 10mm OD collar at the input provides wall thickness around the D-bore.

The output end has a blind hole (5.15mm × 11mm deep) centered on the shaft axis, extending from the output face of lobe 2 through into the bridge zone. A 5mm × 20mm ground steel dowel pin (h6) is pressed into this hole and extends through the 2mm clearance gap into the 625 bearing in the output hub, providing rigid radial support for the shaft's free end. Pin breakdown: 11mm insertion + 2mm gap + 5mm bearing + 2mm proud = 20mm.

The bridge between the two lobes (spanning the 2mm inter-disc spacer zone) is enlarged to 23.10mm OD (lobe OD + 6mm, 3mm radial flange per side) and acts as a bearing retention flange, preventing the two 6003 bearings from sliding toward each other. The bridge is a ruled loft that transitions the eccentric center from (+e, 0) to (−e, 0).

## 2. Bearings

### 2.1 Eccentric Bearings — 6003-2RS

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Quantity | 2 (one per disc) |
| Designation | 6003-2RS |
| Bore (d) | 17mm |
| OD (D) | 35mm |
| Width (B) | 10mm |
| Type | Deep groove ball bearing, sealed |
| Dynamic load rating | ~5.4 kN (typical) |
| Purpose | Supports cycloidal disc on eccentric shaft |

Each bearing press-fits into the center bore of one cycloidal disc. The eccentric shaft's lobed sections seat in the bearing bore.

### 2.2 Output Bearings — 6814-2RS (×2, end-to-end)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Quantity | 2 |
| Designation | 6814-2RS |
| Bore (d) | 70mm |
| OD (D) | 90mm |
| Width (B) | 10mm each (20mm total) |
| Type | Deep groove ball bearing, sealed |
| Dynamic load rating | ~7.0 kN (typical) |
| Purpose | Main output support, carries radial + moment loads |

Two bearings mounted end-to-end in the housing. The inner races sit on the output hub. The outer races sit in the housing bore. Paired arrangement provides significantly better moment load resistance than a single bearing.

**Clearance check — output pins vs. output bearing:**

- Output bearings sit at z=37–57mm; discs at z=13–35mm — axially separated, no interaction with disc pin holes.
- Hub pin holes (Ø4.20mm on 60mm circle) span radius 27.9–32.1mm — well inside the 35mm bearing inner-race bore.

### 2.3 Input Shaft Support Bearing — 625-2RS

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Quantity | 1 |
| Designation | 625-2RS |
| Bore (d) | 5mm |
| OD (D) | 16mm |
| Width (B) | 5mm |
| Type | Deep groove ball bearing, sealed |
| Dynamic load rating | ~1.0 kN (typical) |
| Purpose | Supports eccentric shaft at output side |

Located in the output hub, supporting the eccentric shaft's free end via the 5mm steel dowel pin.

---

## 4. Axial Stack-Up

Measured from motor mounting face inward:

| Layer | Thickness | Running Total |
|---|---|---|
| Motor-side housing plate wall | 5mm | 5mm |
| Motor plate inner wall | 4mm | 9mm |
| Input clearance (D-shaft collar) | 4mm | 13mm |
| Cycloidal disc 1 + 6003 bearing | 10mm | 23mm |
| Inter-disc spacer | 2mm | 25mm |
| Cycloidal disc 2 + 6003 bearing | 10mm | 35mm |
| Clearance to output bearing | 2mm | 37mm |
| Output bearings (2 × 6814) | 20mm | 57mm |
| Output-side housing wall | 8mm | 65mm |

**Total housing depth: ~65mm** (not including motor body protrusion)

**Output hub protrusion:** the rotating output hub extends **2mm proud of the 65mm housing** (its output face is at z=67mm) so the arm link clears the stationary output cap. This is an output-side stub on the rotating member — it does not change the housing depth or the 8mm output wall; the cap, ring gear body, and motor plate are unaffected.

**Housing depth is bolt-pinned:** the 65mm axial depth cannot be shortened without changing a purchased part. The M4×60 housing bolt occupies counterbore 4.5mm + 60mm = 64.5mm from the motor face, so any housing shorter than ~64.5mm would let the bolt tip protrude past the output cap (`tests/test_assembly_clearances.py::test_bolt_does_not_protrude`). Material/space savings therefore come from the rotating hub (lightening recess + 1mm-shorter proud), not the housing envelope.

**Total assembly depth including NEMA 17:** ~65mm housing + 48mm motor body = **~113mm** (motor pilot recesses 2mm into the motor plate's outer face — already inside the 65mm housing depth, so it doesn't add or subtract from the total). The 2mm hub stub adds to the output-side interface but not to the housing/motor envelope.

## 5. Housing Design Notes

### 5.1 Overall Envelope

| Dimension | Value |
|---|---|
| OD | 140mm |
| Depth | ~65mm (housing only) |
| Housing bore (ring pin area) | 116mm |
| Output bearing seat OD | 90.15mm (press fit for 6814 outer race) |
| Output bearing seat depth | 20mm (for 2 × 6814) |

### 5.2 Housing Split

Recommend splitting the housing into 3 printed parts:

1. **Motor plate** — NEMA 17 bolt pattern, 15mm shaft bore for motor shaft pass-through, 21 ring-pin through-holes (4.20mm ⌀), 8× M4 counterbore holes (7.4mm ⌀ × 4.5mm deep) on outer face. Plate is 9mm thick uniform — the previous Ø100mm × 1mm inner-face recess has been replaced by trimming the entire plate to that level. M3 motor-bolt heads sit flush with the inner face in 3mm counterbores.
2. **Ring gear body** — Main cylinder (48mm tall) with 21 ring-pin blind holes (4.20mm ⌀, 31.5mm deep, chamfered entry), output bearing seat bore, 8× M4 clearance through-holes. Lateral pin retention is provided by the motor plate (9mm through-holes) plus 3.5mm engagement at the bearing-zone end. No shoulder ring — 6814 bearings retained by press-fit + output cap.
3. **Output cap** — Ø86.15mm center bore (2mm radial lip retains 6814 outer races against the output cap face), seals housing, 8× hex nut pockets (7.2mm AF × 4.0mm deep) on outer face.

**Shared outer profile**: all three parts share the same outer silhouette — an 8-pillar / 8-window pattern around the bolt circle (pillars 18mm wide at the bore, 10mm wide at the OD, one per M4 bolt). The motor plate and output cap sit directly on the ring gear body's pillar faces; no continuous rim anywhere. The profile is generated by a single shared cutter (`src/helpers/housing_profile.py:build_reveal_window_cutter`) that every housing builder subtracts from its base solid, guaranteeing all three parts stay geometrically aligned. The central solid regions (motor mount on the plate, bearing-retention annulus on the cap) are untouched.

**Outer-edge chamfer** (`cfg.housing.edge_chamfer`, default 1.5mm): a shared post-process helper (`src/helpers/housing_profile.py:chamfer_outer_silhouette`) breaks the external edges of all three parts; **faces that mate against an adjacent part are left sharp** so the stack still seats flush. Applied per part after the windows are cut:

- **Motor plate** and **output cap** — the *entire* outer perimeter of the externally-facing end face (motor mounting face / output back face) is beveled: pillar outer arcs, the inner arcs between pillars, and the pillar side edges (taken from the face's outer wire, so internal bolt/shaft/pilot/nut-pocket holes stay sharp), plus the 8 pillar outer **vertical** corners. The inner (mating) face perimeter stays sharp.
- **Ring gear body** — both end faces mate, so only the 8 pillar outer **vertical** corners are beveled (no end-rim chamfer). Its window cut-outs are left crisp: the stepped bore splits the inner window edges into short segments that the OCCT chamfer kernel cannot bevel (`StdFail_NotDone`).

On the assembled stack this reads as one continuously beveled outer barrel with flush, sharp seams at the part interfaces. Set `edge_chamfer = 0` to disable; keep ≤2mm to preserve the nut-pocket-to-OD wall.

Parts joined with 8× M4 × 60mm socket head cap screws on a 125mm bolt circle. Bolt heads sit in counterbores on the motor plate; M4 hex nuts captured in hex pockets on the output cap.

### 5.3 Output Hub / Plate

A separate printed PETG part (3D-printed; an aluminum version is also viable) that:

- Has 4× blind clearance holes (4.20mm × 19mm deep) on the 60mm pin circle for 4mm dowel pins, closed by a 1mm ceiling on the output-cap side. Depth references the 20mm bearing-grip zone (`cfg.stack_up.output_bearing_total`), so it stays fixed regardless of the proud extension
- Passes through the 2× 6814 bearing inner races (hub OD = 70.3mm; 70mm bearing inner race + 0.3mm interference grip)
- **Output face protrudes 2mm past the chassis.** The hub is 30mm tall (`output_bearing_total` 20mm + `output_wall` 8mm + `proud_above_cap` 2mm), so its output face sits at **z=67mm — 2mm proud of the output cap's outer face (z=65)**. The rotating arm-link interface therefore clears the stationary cap with a 2mm air gap (no rubbing). The proud section passes through the cap's Ø86.15mm bore with ~7.9mm radial clearance. Tune via `cfg.output_hub.proud_above_cap` (trimmed 3→2mm to save hub material)
- **Arm-link mount:** 4× M4 clearance through-holes (4.4mm ⌀) on a 50mm bolt circle, offset 45° from the output pins. Each hole runs the full height into a **captive M4 hex-nut pocket (7.2mm AF × 4mm deep) on the inner face** — the arm-link bolt drops from the proud face, through the hub, and threads into the trapped nut (no threads cut in PETG). Drop the 4 nuts into the pockets **before** pressing the hub through the 6814 bearings. Tune via `cfg.output_hub.arm_mount_*`
- The central 6mm shaft clearance bore is capped at the bearing-grip zone (runs z=37→57 only). Above that the block is solid **except for a central lightening recess** (Ø36mm, ~9mm deep) cut into the proud arm-mount face — it reclaims ~9cm³ of otherwise-dead material; the arm link bears on the r=25→35mm annulus around the bolt circle. Tune via `cfg.output_hub.arm_mount_pocket_dia` (set 0 for a fully sealed face)
- Houses a 625 bearing seat (Ø16.2mm × 5mm) on the inner-face side to support the eccentric shaft output end

## 6. PETG Print Tolerances

**Important context:** PETG holes print **0.10–0.20mm undersized** vs. the design value due to cooling shrinkage, elephant foot, and arc overshoot at the top of round holes. The positive offsets in the table below are **print compensation** — they shift the as-printed dimension back toward nominal. As a result:

- A "+0.20mm" pin hole (designed 4.20mm, printed ~4.00–4.10mm) lands at a **slip-to-light-press fit** on a 4mm dowel — the pin is held primarily by friction, with surrounding capture features (closed ends, adjacent parts) acting as backup retention.
- A "+0.15mm" bearing seat (designed 90.15mm for the 6814 outer race, printed ~90.00mm or slightly under) lands at a **firm press fit**. The smaller 625 outer race seat in the output hub uses a looser +0.20mm offset (designed 16.2mm, printed ~16.00–16.10mm) — a **slip-to-light-press fit** to ease assembly of the small bearing in PETG.
- Designing a hole *smaller* than the steel part (negative offset) is unsafe — print shrinkage stacks on top and the joint either won't assemble or splits the PETG.

In short: **everything ends up a press fit on a real print**; the offset just controls *how tight*. The "clearance" / "press" labels below are design-relative, not as-printed.

| Fit Type | Nominal Adjustment | Application |
|---|---|---|
| Bearing outer race → housing | +0.15 to +0.20mm on bore ⌀ | 625 outer race seat in output hub (+0.20mm), 6814 outer race seat in ring gear body (+0.15mm) |
| Bearing inner race → shaft/hub | −0.05 to −0.10mm on shaft ⌀ | Output hub through 6814 inner race |
| Ring pin holes (motor plate) | +0.20mm on hole ⌀ (4.20mm) | 4mm pins, through-holes (slip-press as printed) |
| Ring & output pin holes (gear body / hub) | +0.20mm on hole ⌀ (4.20mm) | 4mm pins, blind holes (slip-press as printed) |
| Sliding / clearance fit | +0.20 to +0.30mm on hole ⌀ | Output pin holes in disc, disc center bore |
| Motor shaft D-bore | +0.065mm on bore ⌀ (5.13mm for 5mm motor shaft) | Eccentric shaft D-bore receiving NEMA 17 shaft (slip-to-light press as printed) |
| Support pin clearance bore | +0.075mm on bore ⌀ (5.15mm for 5mm pin) | Steel dowel pin hole in eccentric shaft output end (firm press as printed) |
| General mating surfaces | +0.15mm clearance | Housing halves, spacers |

**Notes:**

- Print all cycloidal discs flat (lobes in XY plane) at 100% infill
- Use 0.16mm or finer layer height for bearing seats
- Test-print a bearing fit gauge before committing to full parts — every printer/filament combination shrinks differently, so the +0.20mm compensation may need tuning
- PETG shrinks ~0.3–0.5% on large dimensions (140mm housing may need to be designed at ~140.5mm)

## 7. Performance Estimates

| Parameter | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Motor torque | 0.45 Nm | Typical NEMA 17 48mm |
| Gear ratio | 20:1 | |
| Theoretical output torque | 9.0 Nm | Before losses |
| Estimated efficiency | 55–65% | 3D printed, no pin bearings |
| **Practical output torque** | **5.0–5.9 Nm** | |
| Max payload at 400mm | ~1.3–1.5 kg | Including arm weight |
| Input speed (typical) | 200–500 RPM | |
| Output speed | 10–25 RPM | |
| Backdrivability | Not backdrivable | Inherent to cycloidal drives |

**Torque budget warning:** 5–6 Nm at the shoulder with 400mm reach is marginal for a 3-DOF arm. The arm structure, two additional joint motors, and wiring may consume most of the payload budget. This design is suitable for a lightweight demonstrator arm. For heavier payloads, consider upgrading to NEMA 23 or increasing the ratio.

## 8. Cycloidal Disc Profile

The disc profile is an **epitrochoid** defined by:

```
x(θ) = R·cos(θ) − r·cos(θ + ψ) − e·cos(N·θ)
y(θ) = −R·sin(θ) + r·sin(θ + ψ) + e·sin(N·θ)

where:
  ψ = atan2(sin((1 − N)·θ), (R / (e·N)) − cos((1 − N)·θ))

  R = ring pin circle radius = 54.00mm
  r = ring pin radius = 2.00mm
  N = number of ring pins = 21
  e = eccentricity = 1.50mm
```

The number of lobes on the disc = N − 1 = 20, giving the 20:1 ratio.

Generate this profile at high resolution (e.g., 1000+ points per full revolution of θ from 0 to 2π) and export as DXF or SVG for CAD import.
